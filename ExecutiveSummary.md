## Analyzing web results

### CTR
The overall web CTR is up to 10,02%. 

Daily CTR results were up to 11,22% during March the 1st and were decreasing day by day. On March the 7th, the overall rate was near to 9% CTR. It could be due to less interest from first to last day from users maybe on a digital campaign with click goal or on a PR activity.

There is no much info about which is 'a' and 'b' group but it could be and UX A/B testing or different targets. 'a' group CTR was higher during first days, reaching more than 12% during the first three days. 'b' group CTR increased after the fourth day, it could be due to optimization. 

### Zero Results Rate

Zero Results Rate showed different website performing results day by day and also grouped by type. 

Considering that zero results came from users who didn't let a page loading because they left before, could help to measure which page performed better pushing user to pursuit a goal.

'a' group got higher zero results rate than 'b' group, so if it's an A/B testing, b pages performed better, helping user to reach the goad. 

### Most visited pages

If this report analyzes a website like Infojobs, it could be interesting to know if users used to start the visit from Home page or from a job post. If Home was the initial point for the majority of the users it could help to improve promotion activity and also to improve SEO activity, so users could find jobs directly on different search engines. 

On the other way, if the majority of the users came from different jobs posts it could be interesting to improve Home design, content and promotion to let people know how many advantages they could get from looking jobs inside the web, tracking their jobs applications, etc.

### Session length

Knowing session length could help the platform to know where people spent most time: looking for jobs, reading jobs offers or applying to them. Also, it's important to know how much time, users spent on the website and if they used to let the browser opened until the session is off automatically. Comparing users time-spent with an average of time per page, the platform could know if users used to find what they were looking for.
